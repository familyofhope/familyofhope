      caption: This is Jackline. In this photo, taken when we first met, she earned a living by selling glue to the addicted boys in town.  We have since had the opportunity to minister to her. Now she sells clothes and hopes to have a restaurant one day.  She has been coming to the house Sundays after church to make chapatis (like tortillas) for some of the guys.

      caption: A customer arrived...  The Glue is poured into a small plastic bottle, the boys inhale the fumes to get high and escape their pain. It is very addictive.

      caption: A loose brick in the sidewalk reveals a gutter being used as night shelter by one of the boys who lives on the streets.  This is the very spot where the ministry of Family of Hope was born.  (see the 'about the ministry' section of this site for the full story.

      caption: Dave with Sammy. Sammy is one of the young men we are trying to reach.  There have been some real successes with Sammy...and some setbacks.  At this time Sammy is no longer living at the house and has returned to the streets.  Please continue to pray that God would really get hold of Sammy, and all of the other boys here, who so desperately need Him.
